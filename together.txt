The aim of the project is to take a deep dive into the health metrics of the different 3D design models that are being produced during the design process. For this purpose, I will use the datasets being produced by Autodesk Revit, the main design software we use. Revit is a BIM (building information modelling) software that produces data infused 3D geometry, and facilitates the design of different disciplines through the design and construction process. It is capable to creating exact replicas of buildings and infrastructure projects that can perform and be evaluated in lieu of the physical projects. However, the information that I will examine relates to the files themselves and their performance during the design stage.
